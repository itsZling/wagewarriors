Making a fork:

1.) Go to github, make a fork (This will  allow you to make changes to your code locally incase things go wrong)
2.) run this in your terminal `git clone https://github.com/itsZling/wagewarriors.git`
3.) then change your diretory to the folder (ex. cd wagewarriors)
4.) now run `git remote rename origin <your name>` in your terminal
5.) And finally go back to your fork on Github, copy the link, and run `git remote add origin <your link>`

This will let you have your own fork, that allows you to make pull requests to main

Basic GitHub commands:

0.5.) `git pull` (updates your local code to match main) !MAKE SURE YOU ARE UP TO DATE BEFORE WORKING!
1.) `git add .` (adds all new files for staging) !DO THIS BEFORE COMMITING!
2.) `git commit -am "<message of what changes you made since last commit>"` (commits all changes made with the message you put in the quotes)
3.) `git push origin` (pushes all changes to Github from local)

when you want everyone to use your changes:
go back to your Github fork and click contribute --> pull request

I will handle merges to make sure everything is working
msg me on teams or we can talk in person if you have any questions
